  <h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
  <img src="../i/itau-case/outcomes.png" width="430"/>
  <p class="note">The goal was to design a secure and intuitive self-service 
    experience that allowed users to lock and unlock their cards directly from 
    the app, reducing dependency on support and improving perceived control, 
    security, and peace of mind. The expected UX outcome was clarity in status, 
    confidence in the action, and effortless access to the feature when it mattered most.</p>
