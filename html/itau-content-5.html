  <h2>Process & Stages</h2>
  <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
  <p class="note">We ran focused tests to validate two core things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Findability: Could users locate the feature under pressure?</li>
    <li>Clarity: Did users understand the current card status—blocked vs. active—with no room for doubt?</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>
    Tests revealed that iconography alone wasn’t enough. Clear confirmation states and 
    contextual copy were added to eliminate misinterpretation.
